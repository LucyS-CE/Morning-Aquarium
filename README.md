This is a collection of a few web pages made for a virtual aquarium in our imagination.
Containing the starting page, ticket page, feature page and so on.

It was a very naive project that I created when I was in high school. 
- I have been working on improving it these days.

Thanks for the help from Alice, Patra, and Patricia! We are such a great team! Also, thank you, Mr.Chu, our amazing CS lecture instructor!
