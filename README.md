This is a collection of a few web pages made for a virtual aquarium in our imagination.
Containing the starting page, ticket page, feature page and so on.

It is a very naive project which was made when I was in high school. 

Thanks for the help from Alice, Patra, and Patricia! We are such a great team! Also thank you, Mr.Chu, our CS lecture instructor!
